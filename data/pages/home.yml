  title: The Wales France Business Forum!
story: >-
  The Wales France Business Forum – colloquially known as Le Club - is the Franco-Welsh networking business forum. Le Club’s purpose is to stimulate networking, partnership development and trading opportunities between organisations with both Welsh and French links – whether these links are through their business operations or through their people.

It is a not-for-profit business club, and is open to anyone with existing or ambitions to grow Franco-Wales business relations.

Founders of Le Club are its Chair, Céline Jones, Solicitor, Head of the French Desk at Geldards LLP and Avocat Conseil auprès du Consulat Général et de l’Ambassade de France à Londres, and Dan Langford, Group Marketing Director at leading recruitment firm Acorn.

Le Club was launched at the British Embassy in Paris at a reception hosted by the British Ambassador to France, Lord Llewellyn and the Secretary of State for Wales, Rt Hon Alun Cairns MP.
